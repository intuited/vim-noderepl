*noderepl.txt*  Vim interface to node.js REPL

noderepl creates an interface to a node repl session
in a Vim buffer.


SETUP                 *noderepl-setup*

Before you can use noderepl from within vim,
you will have to start an instance of the server.

This can be done by running the command >
    node deps/noderepl/server/src/replique.js
from wherever noderepl is installed.

The Python client can be used to test whether or not the server is working: >
    $ deps/noderepl/client/poste.py evaluate '["hello", "world"].join(" ")'
    'hello world'


VARIABLES             *noderepl-variables*

g:noderepl_connect    *noderepl_connect*

  Determines the parameters used to connect to the noderepl server.

  By default this will use port 4994 on the local host,
  with a timeout of 2 seconds.

  This variable should be a Dictionary containing any or all of the keys
  `host`, `port`, and `timeout`.


COMMANDS              *noderepl-commands*

NodeRepl [context_name]           *:NodeRepl*

  Starts a new REPL in a new buffer.

  If no context name is given, the default is used.


NodeReplContext [context_name]    *:NodeReplContext*

  If invoked from an existing REPL, switches the context.

  Otherwise functions like |:NodeRepl|.


CONCEPTS              *noderepl-concepts*

Contexts              *noderepl-contexts*

  A REPL session is bound to a given execution context.

  That context determines the values of all top-level variables.

  More than one REPL session can be bound to a given context,
  and a session's context can be changed with |:NodeReplContext|.


INTERFACE             *noderepl-interface*

Keybindings for the REPL are based on those for the VimClojure addon.

Specifically:

  - CTRL-UP and CTRL-DOWN  move backwards and forwards in the history
  - ENTER                  attempts to evaluate the current expression.
                           If the text given constitutes a syntax error,
                           the cursor is moved to the next line
                           and entry continues.
                           Pressing ENTER again will attempt to re-evaluate
                           the entire text.

The string "Node=>" is the REPL prompt.
Deleting all or part of the prompt will confuse the REPL.  Don't do that.
